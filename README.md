# 🤖 AutoOps AI – Skill-to-Task Matcher

A smart AI system that analyzes job roles, responsibilities, and resumes to match employee skills with specific tasks. Built to help organizations automate workforce planning, reduce redundancy, and increase productivity.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Manual workforce mapping is inefficient, subjective, and error-prone. Companies struggle to:
- Match employee skills to exact tasks
- Avoid overlapping responsibilities
- Identify automation opportunities

**AutoOps AI** solves this by using NLP and embeddings to build an objective skill-to-task mapping engine.

---

## 🧠 Solution Overview
This project uses:
- SBERT (Sentence-BERT) to embed job roles and task descriptions
- Cosine similarity to measure alignment
- A ranking engine to recommend best task matches for each skill or resume

---

## ✅ Example Output

**Input Resume Snippet:**
> "Led deployment of scalable APIs using Python and Docker for logistics systems."

**Top 3 Task Matches:**
1. "Develop and deploy containerized microservices using Docker" – Score: 0.87
2. "Design backend APIs for logistics tracking" – Score: 0.85
3. "Implement scalable backend services using Python" – Score: 0.82
